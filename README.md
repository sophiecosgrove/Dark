# Dark
In fulfillment of the week 5 CRUD application project

Requirements
To create a CRUD application of our choice that uses the technologies and methods we have learned up to this point namely: *A Kanban board *A relational database to store at least two tables persistently and a model of their relationship *Clear documentation and a risk assesment *A python based CRUD application made using best practices such as TDD *Test suites and automated tests for the application. Must have a high coverage with consistent reports and evidence *A functioning front end *A version control system using the Feature-Branch model *Code built through a CI server and deployed to a cloud based VM

Solution 
I have designed a blog based on the Netflix show 'Dark'. The program is about timetravel, with the plot of the show becoming complicated. Therefore, I decided to make a website displaying the events in the show so that viewers can keep on track with the plot.
Users are able to create, retrieve, update and delete both characters and events using the website interface, which is then connected to an sql database where the information is stored. 

Technologies Used
Kanban Board: Trello
Database: GCP SQL Server
Programming language: Python
Unit Testing with Python (Pytest)
Integration Testing with Python (Selenium)
Front-end: Flask (HTML), CSS, JavaScript
Version Control: Git
CI Server: Jenkins
Cloud server: GCP Compute Engine

Future improvements
I could add photographs and these would help identification of the characters and also improve the experience of using the website.
A more detailed and graphically relevant time line would show events and their implications in a more structured and meaningful way. The show follows a very complicated plot, so a page for plot theories and latest developments in the plot would be useful and it would also allow for a more enjoyable experience of the website if users could exchange and contribute their own theories.
